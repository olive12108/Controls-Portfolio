# Control Systems Portfolio Project - Ball on Beam System

## Introduction

In the Spring Semester of 2021, I took EEET-427, Control Systems. 

To wrap up the course, students had to complete a portfolio project. This project served several purposes: to re-enforce the concepts of control systems learned throughout the course, to document the student's learning of control systems, and to serve as an example of the work done throughout the semester.
